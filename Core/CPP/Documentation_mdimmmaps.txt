This is the documentation for the multidimensional multimaps approach

This approach is for tracking nodes, most particularly joints, with a more mathematical than language-based organization

This approach doesn't focus on gestures or UX functions, for example

It can, but isn't designed for that

It's designed for high-performance data analysis, for purposes like surgical training

It doesn't have convenient object names and easy ways for developers to pinpoint data, unlike the class systems

It's fast and best understood by developers who are already familiar with it

This is probably best as a "cold" "specific-generic"

Including it as an alternative engine could work, but might bloat the code, and substract from genericism a bit

This will need a wrapper

Note the possibility of extending multidimensional multimaps to body as a whole, while noting the memory required to store entire body data

Note on current errors: most are probably related to the localized presentation of the nested multimaps structure
