* --------------
* The Efficio Runtime project automatically documents itself in a post-build step using [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/ "Doxygen Homepage"). To take advantage of the documenting feature, simply add the doxygen executables to the Windows PATH environment variable. The current documentation can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abantech/EfficioCPP/master/EfficioRuntime/doc/html/index.html "EFficio in C++ Runtime Documentation")
